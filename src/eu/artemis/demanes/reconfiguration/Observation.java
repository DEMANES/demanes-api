/**
 * <p>
 * An Observation is the unit of monitoring the system for reconfiguration. The
 * user must use Observations to monitor the system in any way the Observation
 * allow it to. If there is no Observation object that enables the monitoring of
 * the system, then it cannot be monitored.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Every Observation has a unique identifier that denotes the type of
 * observation that it provides. This identifier must be specific not only for
 * the type of observation, but also what specific component of the system it
 * will observe.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Once an Observation exists, and has been made available to the system, the
 * user may call the {@link #getValue()} method. This will do the actual
 * observation and provide the value that represents the status.
 * </p>

/**
 * <h2>Assumptions</h2>
 * 
 * <p>
 * It is possible that the results of the observation are a buffered version of
 * the information. This means that calling {@link #getValue()} will not do the
 * observation itself, but the information is gathered at some intermediate
 * moment. This is a choice of the designer of the Observation, but will have to
 * be stated explicitly to the user.
 * </p>
