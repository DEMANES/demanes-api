 * An object having the the Observer interface (so it is an observer) is the
 * interface to obtain {@linkplain Observations}s. Every system component which
 * provides information as input for reconfiguration should come with at least
 * one observer.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Observers are made by the designers of the corresponding system component,
 * and can provide one or more {@linkplain Observations}s which indicate what
 * the status is of the component. The observer is merely the interface to
 * observations that correspond to a component, and should not contain the
 * functionality to monitor the component itself.
