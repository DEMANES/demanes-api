 * invoking the correct {@linkplain Action} object, identified by it's

	 * @param id
	 *            In order to resolve which Action to invoke, the identity of
	 *            the corresponding Action should be provided. To obtain a list
	 *            of available actions from this ActionProvider, use the
	 *            {@linkplain #getActions()} function.
	 * @param arguments
	 *            The arguments may indicate a specification of how the action
	 *            should be invoked. For instance in order to modify a parameter
	 *            of a component, the new parameter value can be one of the
	 *            elements in the argument list.
	 * @throws InexistentActionID

	 *             an exception is thrown, indicating that the this identifier
	 *             does not exist. (As far as this ActionProvider concerns)
	 * @throws ActionInvocationException
	 *             Is thrown if the invoked action cannot successfully complete.
