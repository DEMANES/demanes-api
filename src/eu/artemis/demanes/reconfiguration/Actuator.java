/**
 * <p>
 * An object implementing the Actuator interface (so it is an actuator) is the
 * interface to obtain {@linkplain Action}s. Every system component which is
 * reconfigurable should come with at least one actuator.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Actuators are made by the designers of system component, and can provide one
 * or more {@linkplain Action}s by which the components can be changed. The
 * actuator is merely the interface to actions that correspond to a component,
 * and should not contain the functionality to change the component itself.
