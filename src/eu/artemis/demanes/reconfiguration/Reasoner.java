 * <p>
 * The Reasoner specifies the input and the output of the reasoner. It allows
 * for generalized methods for providing the information needed for the reasoner
 * (e.g. KPIs) and methods for providing it's output possibilities.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The input of the reasoner is via an object that provides the reasoner with
 * {@linkplain Observation}s. The output of a reasoner is via an object that
 * provides it with a set of {@linkplain Action}s.
