 * A TriggerPolicy defines the temporal behavior of any {@linkplain Triggerable}
 * object. When the policy is started it will trigger it's registerd objects at
 * a specific time, defined by the implementation.
 * <p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A TriggerPolicy can be started and stopped, and it can be suspended and
 * resumed. The specific behavior of these actions may be implementation
 * specific, but should adhere to the interface's definitions.
