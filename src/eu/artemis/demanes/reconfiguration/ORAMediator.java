/**
 * <p>
 * The ORAMediator defines the interface trough which Observers, Reasoners,
 * Actuators and TriggerPolicies come together. This is the main component in
 * which the mediates these different reconfiguration modules.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * ORAMediator stands for Observe - Reason - Act Mediator. It is the object in
 * which the cycle (similar to the MAPE cycle) is bound together. Hence it uses
 * the Mediator design pattern to combine the three modules. The TriggerPolicy
 * is not part of the acronym as it is not considered as a primary function of
 * the of the mediator, instead it is just a utility.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A ORAMediator is used to combine all interfaces that define the behavior of
 * the reconfiguration. By adding {@linkplain Observers} and
 * {@linkplain Actuators} the user can provide the means by which the system can
 * be observed and modified. The {@linkplain Reasoner} can be set to define how
 * the system can make a decision to take an action. And finally the
 * {@linkplain TriggeringPolicy} can be set to determine when the Reasoner
 * should make these decisions.
 * </p>

 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This makes sure that at all times, the Reasoner is registered as Triggerable
